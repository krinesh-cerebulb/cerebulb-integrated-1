Beginning with the gathering of detailed and accurate requirements, through the orchestration of the client's interview process, we pay attention to every detail. There are no shortcuts. Believe in your client. If we cannot be confident in a company's executive team, corporate culture, business model or future, we will not represent that company. Candidates entrust us with their careers. They deserve our sincere belief that any career moves we propose are sound and align with their stated priorities. When a company becomes our client, we immerse ourselves as its advocate. We become the client."
